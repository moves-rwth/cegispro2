cegispro2 employs a CEGIS-style invariant synthesis techniques to solve the following problems:
Given a probabilistic loop C = while(b){body}, cegispro2 verifies:

- `wp[C](f) <= g` by synthesizing superinvariants
- `ert[C](0) < infty` (universal positive almost-sure termination) by synthesizing ert-superinvariants (cf. Weakest Precondition Reasoning for Expected Run-Times of Probabilistic Programs, Kaminski et al., ESOP'16
- `g <= wp[C](f)` by applying the inductive proof rule by Hark et al. (cf. Aiming Low Is Harder, Hark et al., POPL'20), i.e., by synthesizing subinvariants, proving UPAST, and by verifying conditional difference boundedness.

## 1. Installation


We use [poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) for dependency management.
See [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) for installation instructions for poetry.

In the root directory of this repository, run `poetry install` to install the dependencies in a new virtual environment.

We used [z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) 4.8.17 for our experiments.
To install this version of z3, first run `poetry shell` to enter the virtual environment, then run `pip3 z3-solver==4.8.17`. You are now ready to run cegispro2.

## 2. Usage

cegispro2 is a Python 3 application using [pysmt](https://github.com/pysmt/pysmt) and [probably](https://github.com/Philipp15b/probably).
probably is a library built at the Software Modeling and Verification Group of RWTH Aachen to parse and work with pGCL programs and expectations.
Its internals are [quite extensively documented](https://philipp15b.github.io/probably/), so if there are questions about the input language of cegispro2, you might want to look there.

In the root directory of this repository, run `poetry shell` to enter the virtual environment.


## 3. Accepted Syntax for Loops

Parsing of pGCL programs and expectations is done by the [probably](https://philipp15b.github.io/probably/) library.
There are many examples in the `benchmarks` directory.

An excerpt from the [Lark](https://github.com/lark-parser/lark) grammar for pGCL programs used in the probably library:
```
declaration: "nat" var bounds? -> nat

bounds: "[" expression "," expression "]"

instruction: "skip"                                      -> skip
           | "while" "(" expression ")" block            -> while
           | "if" "(" expression ")" block "else"? block -> if
           | var ":=" rvalue                             -> assign
           | block "[" expression "]" block              -> choice
           | "tick" "(" expression ")"                   -> tick

rvalue: "unif" "(" expression "," expression ")" -> uniform
      | expression

literal: "true"  -> true
       | "false" -> false
       | INT     -> nat
       | FLOAT   -> float
       | "âˆž"     -> infinity
       | "\infty" -> infinity
```

Expressions in programs and expectations can be built from the following operators, grouped by precedence:

1. `||`, `&`
2. `<=`, `<`, `=`
3. `+`, `-`
4. `*`, `:`
5. `/`
6. `not `, `( ... )`, `[ ... ]`, `literal`, `var`

Whitespace is generally ignored.
